TIT	front	intro	m2jl			0		# Introduction to Titus<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Titus<br><br>1. Paul instructs Titus to appoint godly leaders (1:1-16)<br>1. Paul instructs Titus to train people to live godly lives (2:1-3:11)<br>1. Paul ends by sharing some of his plans and sending greetings to various believers (3:12-15)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Titus?<br><br>Paul wrote the Book of Titus. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>### What is the Book of Titus about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to Titus, his fellow worker, who was leading the churches on the island of Crete. Paul instructed him about selecting church leaders. Paul also described how the believers should behave towards each other. He also encouraged them all to live in a way that pleases God.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, **_Titus_**. Or they may choose a clearer title, such as **_Paul’s Letter to Titus_** or **_A Letter to Titus_**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### In what roles can people serve within the church?<br><br>There are some teachings in the Book of Titus about whether a woman or divorced man can serve in positions of leadership within the church. Scholars disagree about the meaning of these teachings. Further study on these issues may be necessary before translating this book.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural **you**<br><br>In this book, the word **I** refers to Paul. Also, the word **you** is almost always singular and refers to Titus. The exception to this is 3:15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What is the meaning of **God our Savior**?<br><br>This is a common phrase in this letter. Paul meant to make the readers think about how God forgave them in Christ for sinning against him, and by forgiving them he saved them from being punished when he judges all people. A similar phrase in this letter is **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**.
TIT	1	intro	c7me			0		# Titus 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-4. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>In verses 6-9, Paul lists several qualities that a man must have if he is to be an elder in the church. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns) Paul gives a similar list in 1 Timothy 3.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Elders<br><br>The church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include overseer, elder, pastor, and bishop.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Should, may, must<br><br>The ULT uses different words that indicate requirements or obligations. These verbs have different levels of force associated with them. The subtle differences may be difficult to translate. The UST translates these verbs in a more general way.

TIT	2	2	xyz3	figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτας…εἶναι	1	Older men are to be	The Greek does not have **are**, but only **older men to be**.

TIT	2	3	gl8e	figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτιδας ὡσαύτως	1	Older women likewise are to be	The Greek does not have **are to be**, but only **older women likewise**.

In 2:7, Paul states the meaning negatively: **uncorrupted**, meaning, **without error**, and in 2:8 he states the meaning positively: **sound, whole**, meaning **correct**. Both terms refer to Titus’s teaching. Use either positive or negative terms in the target language, or use one term with this meaning if it is difficult to use two terms (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
TIT	2	8	xt6v	figs-hypo	ἵνα ὁ ἐξ ἐναντίας ἐντραπῇ	1	so that the opponent may be ashamed	This presents a hypothetical situation in which someone opposes Titus and then becomes ashamed for having done so.
